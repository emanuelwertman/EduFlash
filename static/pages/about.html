      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <div class="mission-content">
        <p>Our mission is to make high-quality learning resources freely accessible to everyone, regardless of background or income. We aim to build a dynamic, community driven platform that will continue to thrive and improve as learners and educators contribute towards lesson plans, discussions, and more. By keeping this project open-source, multilingual, and all inclusive, we are able to empower First Generation Low Income students and all learners around the globe to overcome barriers and pursue an education.</p>
        <p>An education is something that is meant to be shared. It should not be a privledge limited by cost, nor by circumstance. By collaborating and working as innovators, we can build a sustainable and trustworthy platform that will always be evolving with the community.</p>

      <h2>Why We Created This Project</h2>
      <div class="why-content glass">
        <p>Many students, especially those who are first generation and low-income, struggle to find reliable, affordable and well-structured education resources. According to UNICEF, many of these problems arise due to a lack of trained teachers and inadequate education material.</p>
        <p>What if it didn't have to be this way? That is why we created EduFlash. With careful planning, we built a community-powered library of lesson plans and guides. It ensures that anyone with a basic internet access can learn, contribute, and grow.</p>
        <p>We felt that this process would remove barriers, foster development, and keep education alive as long as the community remained alive.</p>
